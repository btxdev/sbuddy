evercookie 0.1 -- never forget.

The only files that need to be in your web directory are:
 evercookie.js
 evercookie.php
 evercookie.swf

If evercookie.php is missing or your server doesn't have PHP
support, evercookie will still function but without support
for auto-generated PNG caching.

If evercookie.swf is missing, evercookie will still function,
but without support for Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies).
